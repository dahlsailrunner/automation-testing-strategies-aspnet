# Automated Testing Strategies for ASP.NET Core

## Getting Started

You should set both the `Api` and the `WebApp` projects as startup projects. In Visual
Studio this can be done by "Configure Startup Projects", then choosing "Multiple startup projects",
and finally choosing the `Launch-UI-and-API` profile.

The solution uses two services that it expects to be running locally. The simplest way to
run these services is to use Docker.  The following commands will start the services.

```bash
docker pull rnwood/smtp4dev
docker run --rm -d --name fakemail -p 3000:80 -p 2525:25 rnwood/smtp4dev

docker pull datalust/seq
docker run --name seq -d --restart unless-stopped -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -p 5341:80 datalust/seq
```

Even without them running you should be able to run the solution.

To see logs, you can navigate to [http://localhost:5341](http://localhost:5341).

To see emails, you can navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Features

This is a simple e-commerce application that has a few features
that we want to explore automated testing strategies for.

Here are the features:

- **API**
  - `GET` based on category (or "all") and by id allow anonymous requests
  - `POST` requires authentication and an `admin` role
  - Validation will be done with [FluentValidation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/index.html) and errors returned as a `400 Bad Request` with `ProblemDetails`
  - A `GET` with a category of something other than "all", "boots", "equip", or "kayak" will return a `500 internal server error` with `ProblemDetails`
  - Data is refreshed to a known state as the app starts
- Authentication provided by OIDC via the [demo Duende Identity Server](https://demo.duendesoftware.com)
- A custom claims transformer will add the `admin` role to "Bob Smith" and any authentication via Google
- **WebApp**
  - The home page and listing pages will show a subset of products
  - There is a page at `/Admin` that will show a list of products that can be edited or added to
  - If you navigate to `/Admin` without the admin role, you should see an `AccessDenied` page
  - Any validation errors from the API should be displayed on the admin section edit pages
  - Can add items to cart and see a summary of the cart (shows when empty too)
  - Can submit an order or cancel the order and clear the cart
  - A submitted order will send a fake email

"Catch" with a refactoring change:

- change the "admin" role to be "administrator" and see what breaks
(maybe make it a different claim type than role and change to a "policy"??)

For the learner:

- Add edit and (soft) delete to the API and WebApp, then write tests
- More complex "cart edit" functionality
- Be able to apply a "promotion" on the Cart page

## VS Code Setup

RUnning in VS Code is a totally legitimate use-case for this solution and
repo.

The same instructions above (Getting Started) apply here, but the following
extension should probably be installed (it includes some other extensions):

- [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)

Then run the API project and the UI project.

## Data and EF Core Migrations

The `dotnet ef` tool is used to manage EF Core migrations.  The following command is used to create migrations (from the `CarvedRock.Data` folder).

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add Initial -s ../CarvedRock.Api
```

The initial setup for the application uses SQLite.
The data will be stored in a file called `carvedrock-sample.sqlite` as
defined in the API project's `appsettings.json` file.

The location of the file is in the "local AppData" folder (`Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData`):

- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\`
- Mac: `/Users/USERNAME/.local/share`

To browse / query the data, you can use some handy extensions:

- In Visual Studio, use the [SQLite and SQL Server Compact Toolbox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErikEJ.SQLServerCompactSQLiteToolbox) extension
- In VS Code, use the [SQLite Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer) extension

### Switching Databases

Switching between SQLite and Postgres and SQL Server is a matter
of commenting out the unused dbcontext setup / initialization logic and
commenting in what you want:

- `Program.cs` of the API project
- `CustomApiFactory.cs` of the InnerLoopTests project
- `SharedFixture.cs` of the InnerLoopTests project

You also need to manually delete the `CarvedRock.Data.Migrations`
folder and recreate the migrations using the instructions above.

Running Postgres for local development:

```bash
docker pull postgres
docker run -d --name carvedrock-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=carvedrock -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

Running SQL Server for local development:

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
docker run -d --name carvedrock-sqlserver -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=Carvedr0ck!" -p 1433:1433 mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
```

## Verifiying Emails

The very simple email functionality is done using a template
from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/leemunroe/responsive-html-email-template)
and the [smtp4dev](https://github.com/rnwood/smtp4dev)
service that can easily run in a Docker container.

There is a UI that you can naviagte to in your browser for
seeing the emails that works great.  If you use the `docker run` command
that I have listed above, the UI is at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

There is also an API that is part of that service and a couple of quick
API calls call give you the content of the email body that you
want to verify:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/messages

### find the ID of the message you care about

GET http://localhost:3000/api/messages/<message-guid>/html
```

## Test Coverage 

To see test coverage for the inner loop tests you've written,
you can use the default [**coverlet**](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet) tool that is included with
the `XUnit` test project template.

```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

Then use the [**reportgenerator**](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) global tool to generate an HTML report.  To install the tool
(you only need to do this once):

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```

Then run the following command to generate the report:

```bash
reportgenerator -reports:".\Tests\**\TestResults\**\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coverage" -reporttypes:Html
```
To remove any contents from previous runs, use the
following PowerShell command:

```bash
gci -include TestResults,coverage -recurse | remove-item -force -recurse
```
